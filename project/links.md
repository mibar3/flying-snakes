For me, creating the virtual environment is not working like in this video so here is how I done. Hope this help!
1. Create a project using the new environment setup with the \venv in the end of the virtual environemt project name.
2. Go to File-> New Projects setup-> Preference fro new project-> Python intrepreter-> then choose Python 3.9(venv)
3. After that add packages under that python version. 
4. Packages to add:1. pip 2. django 3. sqlparse
5. Then click apply so that it will be available for that project and in the terminal you will see (venv).
