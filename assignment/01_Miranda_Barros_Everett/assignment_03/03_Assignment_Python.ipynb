    "Imagine you have to write a (very simple) bookkeepingsystem for a bank that keeps track of the account balances of each of its customers.\n",
    "1. Write a function that spans a dictionary holding a default balance of 0 for an initial list of customers. For simplicity, assume customer names are unique identifier.  (optional) Can you express that same functionality using a lambda function?\n",
    "2. What are elegant ways to add or remove single and multiple customers using the functionality of dict?\n",
    "3. Now write two simple functions that allow you to deposit and withdraw money for a given bank customer.\n",
    "4. Include error messages for inputs that are not permissible, e.g., withdrawing negative amounts or overdrawing the account, etc."
