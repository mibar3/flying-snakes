In order to post the changes made on the repository on to github these are the following commands that must be used in the terminal.

git add .  --> the . means that all is included, if we only wanted to add a specific folder or file we would replace the . with the name of the folder/file
git commit -m "message"  --> this is the most important, any time new changes are being uploaded onto github a brief message must be included summarising the changes made
git push
*type in github username*
*type in github token(special password)*
